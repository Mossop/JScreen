<p>The main data handling routines are contained in this package.</p>

<p>The {@link com.esp.jscreen.InputHandler InputHandler} class
listens on a tcp/ip port for incoming connections. For each connection,
a {@link com.esp.jscreen.TelnetControl TelnetControl} is created to handle
the telnet control codes. Any data that this doesnt understand as telnet
specific codes get passed off to a terminal control class. This class will
vary depending on what type of terminal the user is using. Currently the
test class is {@link com.esp.jscreen.ProgrammableTerminal
ProgrammableTerminal} which can be programmed to deal with the majority of
terminal types.</p>

<p>The terminal control will recognise special codes from the client's
terminal and convert them to a command from the {@link
com.esp.jscreen.commands commands} package. Anything else is assumed to be
text. The terminal control also understands what control sequences to send
to the client for special operations, such as moving the cursor, clearing
lines and changing colours.</p>

<p>All commands and text are then passed onto the {@link
com.esp.jscreen.Session Session} for the client. This gives us our basic
application receiving well described events from the user.</p>
