<p>JScreen is the basis for any text based server side application.</p>

<p>The idea came from the screen application found on various unix
systems. Screen allowed a user logged in remotley to a system to have
multiple screens, each with a different shell running. Switching between
them was acheived by simple keystrokes.</p>

<p>The one big problem is that the standard in available in Java only
passes data on after each line. To get round this the system listens for
a telnet connection on a given port. The socket will pass on data a
character at a time.</p>

<p>The next problem that this project intends to solve in the difficulty of
creating a user interface on a text based system. In order to try and remedy
this, a rich api will be available, wherever possible mirroring the swing
api.</p>
